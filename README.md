GITHUB- is a code hosting platform for verdion control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere

Repository- A Git Repository, or a repo, is a folder that you’ve told Git to help you track file changes.

Clone-A clone is simply a copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a server.

Commit-A commit is a set of one or more changes to a file(or a set of files). Every time you save, it creates a unique ID(“hash”) which helps it keep track of the history.

Push-pushing sends the recent commit history from your local repository up to GitHub. If you're the only one working on a repository, pushing is fairly simple. If there are others accessing the repository, you may need to pull before you can push.

Pull-a pull grabs any changes from the GitHub repository and merges them into your local repository.

Branch-A branch is an independent line of development. You can think of it as a brand new working directory.

Merge-pull request button is deactivated until you have resolved all conflicts

Merge Conflict-Merge conflicts happen when you merge branches that have competing commits

Fetch-Fetching is what you do when you want to see what everybody else has been working on. It’s similar to svn update in that it lets you see how the central history has progressed, but it doesn’t force you to actually merge the changes into your repository. 

Remote- is a common repository that all team members use to exchange their changes. In most cases, such a remote repository is stored on a code hosting service like GitHub or on an internal server.
